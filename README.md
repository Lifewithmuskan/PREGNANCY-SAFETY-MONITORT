# 🛡️ Pregnancy Safety Monitor

## AI + IoT Decision Support System for Safer Pregnancies

---

## 📌 Overview

Pregnancy Safety Monitor is an AI and IoT–powered maternal health decision support system designed to help healthcare workers identify high-risk pregnancies early and take timely action.

The system combines vital health data, patient history, machine learning risk prediction, and LLM-based reasoning to provide clear, explainable, and actionable guidance, especially for rural and resource-limited settings.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

- India accounts for nearly 10% of global maternal deaths, with over 25,000 preventable pregnancy-related deaths each year, largely in rural areas.
- Although high-risk pregnancies can be detected using basic health indicators, continuous monitoring and timely risk assessment are often unavailable.
- There is a strong need for a safe, intelligent, and scalable system that supports early detection and informed decision-making.

---

## 💡 Solution

Pregnancy Safety Monitor acts as a digital safety layer for maternal care by:

- Collecting maternal vitals through IoT sensors and manual inputs
- Storing longitudinal patient history
- Predicting pregnancy risk using machine learning
- Explaining risks and suggesting actions using an LLM-based reasoning engine

This system supports healthcare workers (ASHA, nurses, clinicians) with decision-ready insights, not just raw data.

## 🧪 Machine Learning Component

- **Models Used:** Logistic Regression / Random Forest
- **Purpose:** Predict pregnancy risk level
- **Training Data:**
  - Open maternal health datasets (Kaggle)
  - Simulated longitudinal pregnancy data
- **Design Focus:** High recall for high-risk cases

---

## 🧠 LLM Reasoning Layer

⚠️ **The LLM is not trained on patient data**

The LLM is used only for reasoning and explanation, where it:

- Interprets ML outputs
- Analyzes patient history and trends
- Applies medical guidelines
- Generates simple, human-readable recommendations

---

## 🧰 Integrated Technology Stack

- **IoT:** Vital sign sensors with manual input support
- **Data Storage:** Firebase
- **ML:** Python (scikit-learn)
- **LLM:** Explainable reasoning layer
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI / Flask)
- **Frontend:** Web-based dashboard
- **Deployment:** Cloud-based, scalable architecture

---

## 💰 Cost & Feasibility

- **Hardware Cost:** ₹2,500
- **Production Cost:** ₹1,000
- **Per-Day Cost:** ₹9.2
- **Average Lifespan:** 2 Years

**Low-cost • Scalable • Rural-friendly**
